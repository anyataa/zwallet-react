# Zwallet React Version

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The design pattern for this project is modified MVC with Mini Controller in each layout. 
In the possible way the function to fetch and manipulate data in a specific format will be divided from the view controller (view.jsx).
The component in this project use rfac and use-state to control the state. While, the layout is rcc to ensure the ease in understanding which one is layout and which one is component.


## This project use several libaray:
- react-router-dom
- chart-js
- json-server (db.json (inside the repo))

## If you run this project for the first time:
run: `npm install`
this command used for installing the library used in the project

## virtual DB:
in order to act like fetching data from database this project use json-server
to run this please make sure to install the json-server command as global in your pc

run json-server:
1. go inside the repo folder after you clone it
2. inside zwallet-react folder, type: `json-server -p 4000 db.json` in the terminal


## In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
